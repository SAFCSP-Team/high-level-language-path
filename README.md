# High Level Programming Language Path

## HLL Path Introduction

In this path we will cover the **fundamentals of programming** using HLL and the concepts of **Object Oriented Programming** that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context.

> This path is divided into resource stack that will cover the main concepts related to the path itself, and project stack which helps validate your understanding of these concepts.

## Objectives

By the end of this path you will be able to:

* Understand the fundamentals of High-Level Programming Languages.
* Understand Object Oriented Programming concepts.
* Build softwares using High-Level Programming Languages and OOP paradigm.
