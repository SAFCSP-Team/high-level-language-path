# High-Level-Language-Projects

## High Level Language Path 

In this path we will learn about a high-level language which is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

## The goal of this path

* Ability to learn write a simple program  from any language.
* What is classes and object.
* Understand Classes and objects.
* Understand Inheritance and abstraction.
* understand of variables and data types.
